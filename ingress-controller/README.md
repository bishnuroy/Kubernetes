To Setup Ingress Controller you need to follow following Steps:  You need HELM to install this Igress Controller.

**Step1:**
 - Do git clone in your local system
   - git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress.git
 - Go to helm-chart folder 
   - "cd kubernetes-ingress/deployments/helm-chart/"
 - edit "values.yaml" file as per your needs.
```
rbac:
  ## Configures RBAC if you using RBAC in your cluster make it true
  create: true
```
  - Use daemonset (Bater to have daemonset) 
```
controller:
  ## The name of the Ingress controller daemonset or deployment.
  ## Autogenerated if not set or set to "".
  # name: nginx-ingress

  ## The kind of the Ingress controller installation - deployment or daemonset.
  #kind: deployment
  kind: daemonset
```
  - Give the secret name (Will update Cert-Manager document with it you can issue self-signe of CA cert for your ingress.)
```
defaultTLS:
    ## The base64-encoded TLS certificate for the default HTTPS server. If not specified, a pre-generated self-signed certificate is used.
    ## Note: It is recommended that you specify your own certificate.
    cert: ""
    ## The base64-encoded TLS key for the default HTTPS server. Note: If not specified, a pre-generated key is used.
    ## Note: It is recommended that you specify your own key.
    key: "" 
    ## The secret with a TLS certificate and key for the default HTTPS server.
    ## The value must follow the following format: `<namespace>/<name>`.
    ## Used as an alternative to specifying a certificate and key using `controller.defaultTLS.cert` and `controller.defaultTLS.key` parameters.
    ## Format: <namespace>/<secret_name>
    secret: ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-tls

  wildcardTLS:
    ## The base64-encoded TLS certificate for every Ingress host that has TLS enabled but no secret specified.
    ## If the parameter is not set, for such Ingress hosts NGINX will break any attempt to establish a TLS connection.
    cert: ""

    ## The base64-encoded TLS key for every Ingress host that has TLS enabled but no secret specified.
    ## If the parameter is not set, for such Ingress hosts NGINX will break any attempt to establish a TLS connection.
    key: ""

    ## The secret with a TLS certificate and key for every Ingress host that has TLS enabled but no secret specified.
    ## The value must follow the following format: `<namespace>/<name>`.
    ## Used as an alternative to specifying a certificate and key using `controller.wildcardTLS.cert` and `controller.wildcardTLS.key` parameters.
    ## Format: <namespace>/<secret_name>
    secret: ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-tls
```

  - Use Service type LoadBalancer (If you integrated MetalLB the you can specify LB IP also)
  ```
    service:
    ## Creates a service to expose the Ingress controller pods.
    create: true

    ## The type of service to create for the Ingress controller.
    type: LoadBalancer
  ```
  ```
      ## The static IP address for the load balancer. Requires controller.service.type set to LoadBalancer. The cloud provider must support this feature.
    loadBalancerIP: "9.45.94.227"
  ```
